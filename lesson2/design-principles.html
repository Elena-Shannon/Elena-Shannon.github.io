         <h3>Alignment</h3>
         <div class="content">
            <h4>WOVEN</h4>

                Alignment refers to placing text and other design elements on a page so they line up. Woven magazine is a great example of alignment. Thus, the main body lines up with the hamburger menu and the search icon on both sides. The pictures line up with text boxes. The text and the headers all line up together nicely. Even the dates are aligned with the text on the right. These examples of alignment help to create order and organize the elements.

        <h3>Repetition</h3>
         <div class="content">
            <h4>PURPLE</h4>
            <a href="https://purple.com/"><div>purple.com</div></a>

            <p>
                Repetition refers to replicating a single element many times in a design. Though Purple’s design might not be my favorite, it is a great example of repetition, especially with color. We see various shades of purple repeated throughout the page. We also see repetition in the choice of the Sans serif font and bolded elements. Repetition helps to create unity and serves as an indirect advertisement for the company.

          <h3>White Space/Clean Design</h3>
           <div class="content">
            <h4>DRIBBLE</h4>
            <a href="https://dribbble.com/"><div>dribble.com</div></a>

            <p>
                White space or negative space is the area between design elements. Dribble has a clean and simple design with the image being an obvious focal point. Dribble has a simple design. The space around the elements is not exactly white. It has some color, but it allows the eye to rest instead of distracting it. It’s a conscious effort to add on the side of the designer to create emphasis, structure, and separation without using visible dividers.
